This is the uncompiled source code for M.A.T.T
In order to use it, you must download and install the arduino IDE as well as the libraries for makeblock. 
It is asked that any changes you make or improvements you add be emailed to Patrick Shinn at shinn16@marshall.edu so they
can be applied to M.A.T.T and reshared with others interested in the project.
