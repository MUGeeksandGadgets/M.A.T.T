This is the uncompiled source code for M.A.T.T
In order to use it, you must download and install the arduino IDE as well as the libraries for makeblock. 

https://codeload.github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Libraries/zip/master

It is asked that any changes you make or improvements you add be emailed to Patrick Shinn at shinn16@marshall.edu so they
can be applied to M.A.T.T and reshared with others interested in the project.
